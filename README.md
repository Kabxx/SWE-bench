Please refer our [website](http://swe-bench.github.io) for the public leaderboard and the [change log](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information on the latest updates to the SWE-bench benchmark.

## üëã Overview
SWE-bench is a benchmark for evaluating large language models on real world software issues collected from GitHub.
Given a *codebase* and an *issue*, a language model is tasked with generating a *patch* that resolves the described problem.

## üöÄ Set Up
To build SWE-bench from source, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository locally
2. `cd` into the repository.
3. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to created a conda environment named `swe-bench`
4. Activate the environment with `conda activate swe-bench`

## üíΩ Usage
You can download the SWE-bench dataset from [source](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=164g55i3_B78F6EphCZGtgSrd2GneFyRM) (`.json` file) or from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench)

Find out more about how to use SWE-bench, such as how to...
* [Evaluate](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/master/harness/README.md) models against SWE-bench
* Run SWE-bench's [data collection procedure](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/master/collect/README.md) on your own repositories
* Get model generations with our [inference pipeline](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/master/inference/) and SWE-Llama [13B](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/SWE-Llama-13b) and [7B](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/SWE-Llama-7b) (Parameter Efficient Alternatives: [13B](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/SWE-Llama-13b-peft) and [7B](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/SWE-Llama-7b-peft)).
